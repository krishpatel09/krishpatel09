# Hi, I’m Krish Sangani 👋
I’m a Full Stack Developer who enjoys building real-world web applications with a strong focus on backend architecture and clean code practices.

My journey in development started with curiosity about how websites work behind the scenes — and today, I specialize in designing APIs, managing databases, and connecting powerful backend systems with responsive frontend interfaces.

I primarily work with JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems, using React and Next.js for modern user interfaces, and Node.js, Express.js, and Nest.js for scalable server-side applications. I have hands-on experience with MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis, and I enjoy structuring databases efficiently for performance and reliability.

Beyond just writing code, I’m deeply interested in understanding system flow, deployment processes, and how applications behave in production environments. I have explored cloud deployment, Docker basics, CI/CD workflows, and performance optimization techniques.

Some of the projects I’ve worked on include multi-user typing platforms, SaaS-style dashboards, authentication systems, CRUD-based applications, and full-stack platforms that combine frontend, backend, and database logic seamlessly.

I believe in continuous improvement, writing maintainable code, and building solutions that solve practical problems — not just completing projects, but understanding them deeply.

🚀 Currently focused on improving backend scalability, system design concepts, and cloud-native development.
